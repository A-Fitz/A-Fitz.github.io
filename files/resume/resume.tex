I am the sole software architect for the two teams that support our core web services, the distributed caching system, and an enterprise service bus which all back our borrower and call center agent systems. In 2024, I lead the planning of cost reductions amounting to \$400k in annual savings.\par
Previously, while supporting systems for IVR routing, call center dialing list generation, and SMS notifications supporting 16+ million customers, I navigated the development team through the later stages of a company-wide initiative that tripled the number of production tenant environments.}

               {\\I worked with hundreds of software engineers and architects, managers, and cybersecurity analysts to improve the security posture of Nelnet systems by maintaining automated SAST and SCA implementations, leading threat modeling, and running our vulnerability management program. I regularly reviewed C\#, Java, TypeScript, and SQL for federal and commercial software systems that support 16+ million borrowers. I revived and spearheaded our successful Security Champions Program and architected its custom gamification platform, engaging 70 new security champions over the course of a year. Along with stakeholders from throughout the company, I designed security and compliance training and ensured compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements. I learned to quickly make decisions and assess ridk using the NIST SP 800 series and guidance from sources such as the NIST SSDF and the OWASP ASVS.}

I helped design, implement, and maintain five web applications (Spring/Angular/SQL Server), leading the design of the last system we built. I also maintained software systems using technologies such as IBM Db2, AWS Lambda, the ServiceNow API, Helm, AngularJS, and WebSphere.\par
I helped improve our team's productivity by advocating for and implementing automated code quality
enforcement and procedures to streamline production deployments. I was a notable contributor to the Unifi Design System (https://unifi.nelnet.io/), where I engaged with UI/UX designers and accessibility engineers, then helped hire two developers to work on the project fulltime. I am also proud to have mentored an intern who was hired at Epic after his graduation.}

As a lab assistant I provided support to students enrolled in introductory computer science courses, assisting them understand and complete assessments related to core concepts regarding data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.\par
As an undergraduate researcher I worked in a team under Dr. Selent to research, design, and develop multiple predictive models in Python used to predict student struggle in CSSE courses; our team won 2nd place in the 2019 WSTS Poster Symposium. I also worked under Dr. Alkhushayni to implement a unique set of chronic disease risk assessments for a personal health application.}
