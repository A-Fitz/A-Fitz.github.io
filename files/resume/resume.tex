	      {Jun. 2021 | Present}
	      {IT Software Engineer}
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item As a member of an eight-person Scrum team, I help maintain over twelve software systems while working remotely. Some of the systems have been newly-developed during my time, while others are legacy systems that mostly require production support and security updates. System technologies vary based on need and lifetime; I have gained some experience with AWS.
                     \item I have improved our team's efficiency by advocating for and implementing automated code quality enforcement, proactive maintenance techniques, and procedures to streamline production implementations. I have also studied the enterprise risk management framework and external resources in order to improve the security engineering stature of development teams across the organization.
                     \item I am a notable contributor to the \href{https://unifi.nelnet.io/}{Unifi Design System}. I began as a regular meeting attendee before transitioning into component development, which required active collaboration with UI/UX designers, accessibility engineers, and stakeholders. I then filled in to provide lead development and support during a staffing change, where I assisted with interviews and sharing knowledge with new hires.
                     \item I regularly attend events regarding company culture, professional development, and innovation. I also acted as a mentor to an intern who spent between 15-20 hours per week on our team during the school year.

	      {Senior Assistant, Resident Assistant}
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item As a senior assistant I was responsible for coordinating administrative duties, health and safety protocols, and acting as a co-supervisor for seven resident assistants. I was voted by my peers as the \emph{Senior Assistant of the Semester} in the fall of 2020. I received the \emph{Lifetime Residence Life Award} in the spring of 2021.
	      	\item As a resident assistant I was responsible for overseeing a community of approximately twenty-five undergraduate students, providing information on university resources, and developing an educational atmosphere. I was voted by my peers as the \emph{Staff Member of the Semester} in the fall of 2019.

	      \begin{itemize}
		\item As a lab assistant I provided support to students enrolled in introductory computer science courses, assisting them understand and complete assessments related to core concepts regarding data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.
	      	\item As an undergraduate researcher I worked in a team under Dr. Selent to research, design, and develop multiple predictive models used to predict student struggle in CSSE courses; our team won 2nd place in the 2019 WSTS Poster Symposium. I also worked under Dr. Alkhushayni to implement a unique set of chronic disease risk assessments for a personal health application.
